# Behavioural-Disorder-Detection-in-Children-Using-Machine-Learning

This project aims to create a real-time web app stimulation with a machine learning model where the parents can answer certain early diagnosable questions about ADHD, Dyslexia, Autism, etc. . And then by evaluating the results it can predict whether the kid is prone to such disorders. 
<h1>Problem Statement</h1>
A child having behavioral diseases like dyslexia, dyscalculia, dysgraphia, dyspraxia, autism, or ADHD might show very mild symptoms at early stages and hence makes it difficult for a proper diagnosis. 
Disruptive behavioral disorders are complicated and may include many different factors working in combination.
At times some diagnosis methods may include:
                                          1. Diagnosis by a specialist service
                                          2. In-depth interviews with the parents and children.
                                          3. Assessing the childâ€™s background, medical history, and symptoms.
The above diagnosis methods do not provide an accurate diagnosis at an early age also parents do not consider going to a psychiatrist for some minor initial symptoms.
Also, there are not many digital means to increase the learning quotient of such students. 
This project aims to propose a platform that can harness digital means to detect diseases like Dyslexia, Dyscalculia, Dysgraphia, Dyspraxia, Autism, or ADHD when the symptoms are mild and easier to manage.
So how can we predict these disorders at the right time?
<h1> Novelty Of The Project</h1>
This website for predictive analysis of behavioural disorders is itself a unique concept as there are no other digital means for early diagnosis specially made for children with different prediction tests for different disorders.
 Also we have trained our machine learning model with our custom made data set prepared with a lot of research and surveys which makes our model very accurate. 
No prior dataset were available on the internet for these disorders.
No any such accurate work has been done with both high level predictive analysis and survey for dataset collection.
<h1>Real Time Usage</h1>
<li>The Web-app interface will feature questions relevant to such disorders and allow users to input their answers.</li>
<li>Parents observing their child's behavior will answer certain questions about the symptoms and the time period since they are observing it.</li>
<li>The data inputted will be used as test data which will then show the results.</li>
<li>A Machine learning model will then be fed with the already existing data about these disorders and then trained accordingly.</li> 
<li>The trained model will then predict the results using the inputted data by the parents/users.</li>
<li>In the web-app interface, we will integrate the Machine learning Model and with the real-time data, it can predict if the child has a chance of getting certain disorders or not.</li>
<h1>WORKING</h1>
The working of the system starts with the collection of data and selecting the important attributes. Then the required data is preprocessed into the required format. The data is then divided into two parts training and testing data. The algorithms are applied and the model is trained using the training data. The accuracy of the system is obtained by testing the system using the testing data. This system is implemented using the following modules.

<li>Collection of Dataset</li>
<li>Selection of attributes</li>
<li>Data Pre-Processing</li>
<li>Balancing of Data</li>
<li>Training the Model using various classification algorithms</li>
<li>Disease Prediction</li>

<h3>The GUI interface will be integrated soon!!</h3>
