# Behavioural-Disorder-Detection-in-Children-Using-Machine-Learning

This project aims to create a real-time web app stimulation with a machine learning model where the parents can answer certain early diagnosable questions about ADHD, Dyslexia, Autism, etc. . And then by evaluating the results it can predict whether the kid is prone to such disorders. 
<h1>Problem Statement</h1>
A child having behavioral diseases like dyslexia, dyscalculia, dysgraphia, dyspraxia, autism, or ADHD might show very mild symptoms at early stages and hence makes it difficult for a proper diagnosis. 
Disruptive behavioral disorders are complicated and may include many different factors working in combination.
At times some diagnosis methods may include:
                                          1. Diagnosis by a specialist service
                                          2. In-depth interviews with the parents and children.
                                          3. Assessing the childâ€™s background, medical history, and symptoms.
The above diagnosis methods do not provide an accurate diagnosis at an early age also parents do not consider going to a psychiatrist for some minor initial symptoms.
Also, there are not many digital means to increase the learning quotient of such students. 
This project aims to propose a platform that can harness digital means to detect diseases like Dyslexia, Dyscalculia, Dysgraphia, Dyspraxia, Autism, or ADHD when the symptoms are mild and easier to manage.
So how can we predict these disorders at the right time?
